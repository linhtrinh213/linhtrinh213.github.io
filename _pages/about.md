When I started my Biotechnology program, there were a few specializations to choose from—one of them was *bioinformatics*. My initial thought? Definitely not that one.

But, as you might’ve guessed, I slowly grew curious, and eventually *genuinely interested*  in the subject during my first data analysis project, working with transcriptomics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Still, I had my doubts – if I am cut out for this. 

That was *4 years ago*. Since then, I have taken on internships and jobs to gain more experiences in this field. Along the way, I’ve faced the *challenges* and the difficulties, but also the *joy* overcoming it, all while probably consumed a few too many coffees. Through it all, I’ve come to realize that I really enjoy what I do. Computational biology is challenging, creative, and exciting. 

At the moment, I am focusing on developing *tools* and solutions for biological research, including the application of *ML/DL approaches*. As a master's student, I'm excited to keep learning and see where this journey through science and data leads me next.
