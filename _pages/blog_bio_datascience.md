Coming from a biological background, I always thought my career would be spent mostly in the lab. When I first moved toward data science and bioinformatics, I worried that I would grow too **distant** from the lab and from biology itself.

In a way, that turned out to be true. Over the past few years, working on the computational side, I've spent most of my time in front of a computer—writing code, debugging, analyzing data, and building workflows and automation tools, rather than holding a pipette. To my surprise, I found that I didn’t mind it at all. In fact, I even considered stepping **fully into** data engineering or programming. I enjoy problem-solving, and biological data isn’t like engineering problems. It's noisy, complex, and rarely black and white. Often, there’s no absolute explanation, which sometimes left me discontent and frustrated. 

Lately, I have taken on a few projects that biological knowledge wasn’t required. Only then I realized how much I missed it. Biology still matters deeply to me. It’s what keeps me motivated. The fact that biology *isn’t* black and white is exactly what keeps the fire **burning**. This experience made me realized that computational is the sweet spot between the two worlds I care about.
